# Data Engineering Nanodegree

## Projects

### 1. [Data Modeling with PostgreSQL](https://github.com/jbj2505/dend_01_data_modeling_postgres)
In this project, I applied what I learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. I defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and wrote an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

### 2. [Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/jbj2505/dend_02_data_modeling_apache_cassandra)
In this project, I applied what I learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. I modeled my data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries.
