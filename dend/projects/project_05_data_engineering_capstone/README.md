# Project 5 - Data Engineering Capstone
The capstone project is an opportunity for you to combine what you've learned throughout the program into a more self-driven project. In this project, you'll define the scope of the project and the data you'll be working with. We'll provide guidelines, suggestions, tips, and resources to help you be successful, but your project will be unique to you. You'll gather data from several different data sources; transform, combine, and summarize it; and create a clean database for others to analyze.
