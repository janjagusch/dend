# Project 4 - Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow
In this project, you’ll continue your work on Sparkify’s data infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines. You’ll use the up-and-coming tool Apache Airflow, developed and open-sourced by Airbnb and the Apache Foundation. You’ll configure and schedule data pipelines with Airflow, setting dependencies, triggers, and quality checks as you would in a production setting.
